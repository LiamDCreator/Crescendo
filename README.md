# Crescendo
## Introduction
Crescendo is a 2D fast-paced multiplayer arena brawler and the first multiplayer game I plan to develop and release. My goal with this project is to gain hands-on experience and familiarity with the process of creating multiplayer games.
## How to play
Crescendo is a round-based multiplayer arena brawler where players are dropped into an arena to battle each other using musical instrument-themed weapons. When a player eliminates an opponent, the defeated player respawns, and the victor gains a powerful buff, including a speed boost and an upgraded weapon. As players continue to accumulate kills without dying, they edge closer to reaching their "Crescendo", and once they get about 3-5 kills in a row depending on the weapon they use they will have reached their "crescendo" and win the round.
